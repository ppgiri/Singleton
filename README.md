 



 Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton design pattern in C# is one of the most popular design patterns. In this pattern, a class has only one instance in the program that provides a global point of access to it. In other words, a singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and usually gives simple access to that instance.
